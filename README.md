# Integrating cloud into research CI

CI solutions tend to focus on application development and deployment, both in terms of the testing capabilities and in terms of learning materials. Research software needs can diverge from standard practise for application development, both in terms of development workflow and in terms of testing requirements.

Taking a standard example of Jenkins on Azure, good learning materials exist for standard deployments but some research software corner cases could be better documented.

## Sprint objectives

Create learning resources to supplement existing Jenkins on Azure material for:

* Issues when Jenkins instances with large numbers of projects gain the ability to burst large numbers of on-demand agents


## Learning prerequisites

* [Jenkins on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/jenkins/)
* [Docker on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/docker/)
* [Jenkins with Docker](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/)
